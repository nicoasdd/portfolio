# Portfolio Template

A statically generated portfolio template you can fork to publish your own projects on GitHub Pages — no design work, no build configuration, no code changes required to add new content. Built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.

The template ships with three working **example projects** (one per category) and a fillable **About page**, so the moment you fork it you have a deployable site. From there, swap in your own content one Markdown file at a time.

> Looking for the full feature history? See [`specs/`](./specs/) for the spec, plan, and tasks of every shipped change.

---

## Quick Start (≈ 15 minutes)

1. **Get your own copy.** Click **Use this template → Create a new repository** (preferred) or fork the repo. Pick a repo name — your site will be served at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages.** In your new repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → GitHub Actions**. No workflow file changes needed.

3. **Install locally.**

   ```bash
   nvm use            # picks up .nvmrc (Node 20)
   npm install
   npx playwright install --with-deps chromium    # first time only, for tests
   npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321
   ```

   You should see the three example projects, the example About page, and the category navigation working.

4. **Replace the About content.** Open `src/content/about/profile.md`. Fill in `name`, `headline`, `intro`, `email`, `skills`, and the bio body. Drop your photo at the path you reference from `photo:` (e.g. `public/about/profile.webp`). Detailed instructions are in [Edit your About content](#edit-your-about-content) below.

5. **Add your first project.** Copy `templates/project.md` into `src/content/projects/<category>/<slug>.md`, fill in the frontmatter, and drop a thumbnail under `public/projects/<slug>/`. Full walkthrough in [Adding a project](#adding-a-project) below. _If you use Cursor, you can also paste a GitHub repo URL into chat and let the bundled [`add-project-from-repo`](./.cursor/skills/add-project-from-repo/SKILL.md) skill generate the entry for you. Once you have one or more projects, the bundled [`optimize-project-from-resume`](./.cursor/skills/optimize-project-from-resume/SKILL.md) skill can refresh their narrative copy against your current resume — see [Optimizing project copy with your resume](#optimizing-project-copy-with-your-resume) below._

6. **Push and deploy.**

   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "First content"
   git push
   ```

   The deploy workflow runs automatically on every push to `main`. When it finishes (≈2 min), your site is live at the URL from step 1.

That's it. From here, every new project is one Markdown file plus a thumbnail.

## Common Issues

> Read this section **before** customizing — the first item catches the most common mistake people make with template repos.

### Don't delete the example projects

The three files under `src/content/projects/{personal,startup,corporate}/example-*.md` are doing **two jobs at once**:

- They are working examples that demonstrate the schema and give a forked repo something to render.
- They are also the test fixtures the e2e suite asserts against. The unit suite has a dedicated check (`tests/unit/examples.test.ts`) that fails loudly with a pointer back to this section if any of the three is missing.

**Do not delete them.** If you want them out of your published site, set the environment variable `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true` on your deploy (see [Hiding the examples](#hiding-the-examples)) — they'll stay on disk for the test suite but disappear from the rendered site. Two safe paths:

| Want | Do this |
|---|---|
| Keep examples mixed with your real projects | Nothing — the default works. |
| Hide examples but keep tests passing | Set `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true` on your deploy (recommended). |
| Replace examples in-place with your own | Edit the file content but **keep the slug `example-personal` / `example-startup` / `example-corporate`** so existing tests still resolve. Then update the assertions in `tests/e2e/project-detail.spec.ts` to match your new content. |

The build will print a `[content-validator]` warning if it can't find an example file, and CI will fail the unit suite — so you'll know immediately if something went missing.

### My deploy succeeded but the site is empty

Open your repo's **Settings → Pages** and confirm the source is set to **GitHub Actions**. If you previously had it pointing at a branch (`main` / `gh-pages`), switch to GitHub Actions and re-run the workflow.

### My BASE_PATH is wrong (links 404 on a project repo)

The deploy workflow auto-resolves `BASE_PATH` from `actions/configure-pages`. If you serve from a custom domain (apex), `BASE_PATH` should be `/`. If you serve from `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`, it should be `/<repo>/`. The workflow handles both — but if you customize `astro.config.mjs`, make sure the `base` value still respects the `BASE_PATH` env var.

### `npm run test:e2e` fails on a fresh checkout

You probably haven't installed Playwright browsers yet:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

---

## Local development

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Astro dev server with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Build the static site to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | `astro check` + `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint over `.js`, `.ts`, `.astro` |
| `npm run format` | Prettier across the project |
| `npm run test` | Vitest unit tests (`tests/unit/`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests (`tests/e2e/`) |
| `npm run lighthouse` | Lighthouse CI against the built site |

`HIDE_EXAMPLES` is honored in **dev**, **build**, and **preview** — set it in front of any of the above to preview the hidden state locally:

```bash
HIDE_EXAMPLES=true npm run dev
HIDE_EXAMPLES=true npm run build && npm run preview
```

---

## Adding a project

Adding a project takes **one Markdown file** — no code changes.

> **Shortcut for Cursor users:** if you have a GitHub repo URL handy, the bundled [`add-project-from-repo`](./.cursor/skills/add-project-from-repo/SKILL.md) Cursor skill will clone the repo into a temp directory, infer the title / description / period / tech stack from its README and manifests, and emit a schema-compliant Markdown file under `src/content/projects/<category>/<slug>.md` plus a placeholder thumbnail at `public/projects/<slug>/thumbnail.svg` — for one repo or a batch. Just paste the URL(s) into chat and ask Cursor to add them. The manual flow below still works and is the source of truth for what each frontmatter field means.

### 1. Copy the template

```bash
cp templates/project.md src/content/projects/<category>/<slug>.md
```

`<category>` is one of `personal`, `startup`, `corporate`. `<slug>` is lowercase kebab-case (e.g. `cli-toolkit`).

### 2. Fill in the frontmatter

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `title` | Display name (1–80 chars). |
| `description` | One-line summary (1–240 chars). |
| `role` | Your role on the project. |
| `period` | `{ start: YYYY-MM, end: YYYY-MM \| "present" }`. |
| `techStack` | Array of 1–20 technologies/frameworks. |
| `thumbnail` | Path under `public/` to the card image. |

Optional: `slug` (override filename), `screenshots[]`, `links.{source,live,caseStudy}`, `featured`, `order`, `draft`.

**Blueprint optional fields** (light up the rich featured-card treatment on category pages — all optional, all additive):

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `impactTagline` | Short tagline shown above the project title on cards. Falls back to `description` if absent. |
| `highlightMetric` | `{ label, value, trend?: up \| down \| flat }` — small metric + sparkline on the compact card. |
| `metrics` | Array of up to 3 `{ label, value, unit? }` — drives the 3-tile metric panel on the large featured card. |
| `narrative` | `{ challenge?: [], built?: [], impact?: [] }` — each an array of up to 4 short bullets, rendered as a 3-column CHALLENGE / BUILT / IMPACT band. |
| `architecture` | Array of 2–8 `{ label, icon, note? }` nodes — drives the blueprint architecture strip. `icon` must be one of `users \| api \| db \| cache \| queue \| server \| web \| messaging \| blockchain \| cloud`. |

Projects that omit these fields simply render in the compact card style; no UI breaks. See `src/content/projects/personal/csgo-try.md` and `src/content/projects/corporate/mercadolibre-billing-engine.md` for worked examples.

### About page blueprint fields

`src/content/about/profile.md` also accepts additive optional fields (all live in `aboutSchema` under [`src/content.config.ts`](./src/content.config.ts)):

- `availabilityPills: [{ icon, label }]` — pill row on the identity hero (`icon` ∈ `remote, onsite, hybrid, collab, opportunities, contract, sparkle`). Falls back to deriving a pill from `location` + `availability` when absent.
- `values: [{ icon, title, body }]` — the "What I care about" 4-up grid (`icon` ∈ `craft, performance, accessibility, pragmatism, security, systems`). Section is hidden when empty.
- `process: [a, b, c, d, e]` + `processStatement: "..."` — drives the "Why work with me" 5-step banner. Must be exactly 5 strings when supplied.
- `contact: { email?, github?, linkedin? }` — optional override for the hero contact lines. When absent, falls back to top-level `email` and matching `socialLinks`.

### Landing-page rails (`src/content/site/site.md`)

A single-document collection controls the home credibility strip, the footer systems strip, and the per-category mission copy. Edit this file to change any of those — no code changes required.

The full schema lives in [`src/content.config.ts`](./src/content.config.ts).

### 3. Add image assets

```bash
mkdir -p public/projects/<slug>
# add a thumbnail.svg/png/webp and any screenshots
```

### 4. Verify locally

```bash
npm run build      # fails fast if frontmatter is invalid
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321/projects/<slug>/`.

### 5. Commit and push

```bash
git add src/content/projects/<category>/<slug>.md public/projects/<slug>/
git commit -m "Add project: <slug>"
git push
```

The deploy workflow takes over.

## Optimizing project copy with your resume

Once you have one or more project entries in `src/content/projects/`, the bundled [`optimize-project-from-resume`](./.cursor/skills/optimize-project-from-resume/SKILL.md) Cursor skill can rewrite their narrative copy to match the seniority, focus areas, and vocabulary of where you are in your career today. Useful when:

- You just changed jobs (or got promoted) and want your portfolio to read consistently from your new vantage point.
- You wrote some projects years ago in a junior voice that no longer matches the rest of your work.
- You're tailoring the portfolio for a specific kind of opportunity (platform engineering, product leadership, founder-track, etc.).

### What it does

Given your resume (`.md` or `.pdf`) and either one project or all of them, the skill rewrites every piece of narrative copy in each project file:

- The front-matter `title`, `description`, and `role` fields.
- Every body section in the file: `## Overview`, `## Highlights`, `## Lessons Learned`, and any custom section.

### What it never touches

The skill is deliberately scoped to *narrative*, not facts:

- **`slug`** — your URLs stay stable. (The example slugs are pinned by tests, too.)
- **`period`, `techStack`** — historical facts. The rewrite respects them; it never re-dates a project or claims a tech you didn't use.
- **`thumbnail`, `screenshots[]`, `links.{source,live,caseStudy}`** — asset paths and URLs.
- **`featured`, `order`, `draft`** — your site curation choices.
- **Section heading lines and ordering** — preserved verbatim.
- **Embedded image references, hyperlinks, fenced code blocks, tables, and inline HTML** inside body sections — preserved verbatim. Only the surrounding prose is rewritten.

### Confidentiality guard for `corporate/` and `startup/` projects

The constitution requires that corporate and startup project entries focus on role, impact, and technologies — *not* on proprietary details or NDA-protected names. When you optimize a project under `src/content/projects/{corporate,startup}/`, the skill enforces a stricter rule: the resume contributes only seniority and vocabulary signals. Employer names, customer names, internal product names, and any other proper noun present in the resume but absent from the current project file will *not* be introduced into the rewrite — the skill uses generic descriptors instead ("a major payments processor", not "Stripe").

For `personal/` projects, this guard is off — the personal-portfolio surface is yours to fill.

### Safety net

- **Diff-and-confirm.** Every file write is preceded by a unified diff and an explicit yes/no/skip prompt. There is no auto-approve mode.
- **Uncommitted-changes guard.** If a target project file has uncommitted local edits, the skill refuses to touch it unless you explicitly opt in. Your manual work is never silently overwritten.
- **Schema validation.** Every rewritten file is validated against the same Zod schema in [`src/content.config.ts`](./src/content.config.ts) that the build uses. If the rewritten title/description/role would exceed their length limits, the skill self-tightens once and skips on persistent failure.
- **Idempotency.** Re-running the skill on an already-optimized file with the same resume produces a near-empty diff.

### How to use it

In Cursor chat, invoke it conversationally:

```text
Optimize src/content/projects/personal/cli-toolkit.md using my resume at /tmp/resume.md
```

Or, in batch mode against every project under `src/content/projects/`:

```text
Optimize all my projects with my resume at /tmp/resume.pdf
```

You can also nudge the optimization with a short guidance string layered on top of the resume signal — useful when you want to lean into a specific theme without editing the resume:

```text
Optimize all my projects with /tmp/resume.md, emphasize platform engineering
```

If the guidance contradicts a fact in the resume (e.g., asking the skill to claim a leadership scope your resume doesn't show), the skill surfaces the conflict and refuses to fabricate.

### What you'll see

For each project, the skill prints a status line in the chat:

```text
✓ src/content/projects/personal/cli-toolkit.md       (-7/+9 lines)
↷ src/content/projects/personal/raytracer.md         skipped: declined
✗ src/content/projects/startup/example-startup.md    failed: confidentiality guard tripped (Acme Payments in title)
```

In batch mode, the skill runs `npm run build` once at the end and reports a final summary `<N> optimized, <M> skipped, <K> failed`.

---

## Edit your About content

The About page (`/about/`) and the landing-page teaser are both driven by **a single Markdown file**: `src/content/about/profile.md`. There must be exactly one `*.md` file under `src/content/about/`.

### 1. (First time only) Copy the template

```bash
cp templates/about.md src/content/about/profile.md
```

A starter `profile.md` already ships with the repo, so usually you just edit it in place.

### 2. Fill in the frontmatter

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Your display name (1–80 chars). |
| `headline` | yes | Professional title or one-line tagline (1–120 chars). |
| `intro` | yes | Short paragraph used by the landing-page teaser (1–240 chars). |
| `photo` | yes | Path under `public/` to your photo. |
| `email` | yes | Contact email — rendered as a `mailto:` link. |
| `skills` | yes | Array of 1–40 strings (skills, focus areas). |
| `photoAlt` | no | Override the default `alt` (defaults to `"Portrait of {name}"`). |
| `location` | no | E.g. `"Remote · EU timezone"`. |
| `availability` | no | E.g. `"Open to opportunities"`. |
| `socialLinks` | no | Array of `{ label, url, icon? }`. URLs must be `http(s)`. |
| `resumeUrl` | no | Absolute URL or path under `public/` (e.g. `/about/resume.pdf`). |

`socialLinks[].icon` accepts: `github`, `linkedin`, `x`, `mastodon`, `bluesky`, `email`, `website`.

The body of the file (after the closing `---`) is the long-form bio with full Markdown support. **The body must not be empty.**

### 3. Add your photo and optional CV

```bash
cp ~/Pictures/me.webp public/about/profile.webp
# Then update profile.md: photo: "/about/profile.webp"

# Optional CV
cp ~/Documents/cv.pdf public/about/resume.pdf
# In profile.md: resumeUrl: "/about/resume.pdf"
```

If the photo file is missing at build time, the site falls back to a placeholder so the layout never breaks — but `[content-validator]` will warn in the build log.

### 4. Verify locally

```bash
npm run build      # fails fast if any required About field is missing
npm run dev        # http://localhost:4321/about/
```

The validator prints a confirmation line on success:

```text
[content-validator] About profile validated: profile.md (N skills).
```

---

## Hiding the examples

The example projects are visible by default — that's what makes the freshly-forked site immediately deployable. To hide them on your deployed site (without deleting the files, so the test suite stays green), set the environment variable:

```text
HIDE_EXAMPLES=true
```

### What it does

When `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true`, every project whose slug starts with `example-` is excluded from:

- The landing page project grid.
- The featured-projects list.
- Every category page (`/category/personal/`, `/category/startup/`, `/category/corporate/`).
- The individual project pages (`/projects/example-*/index.html` are not generated).
- The generated `sitemap-*.xml`.

Your real projects are unaffected.

### Where to set it

| Environment | How |
|---|---|
| Local dev/build/preview | `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true npm run dev` (or `build` / `preview`) |
| GitHub Pages deploy (default) | Repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables → New repository variable** named `HIDE_EXAMPLES` set to `true`. |
| GitHub Pages deploy (auto for `content/add-projects`) | Push to a branch named `content/add-projects` — the deploy workflow auto-sets `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true` for that branch regardless of the repo variable. See [For the template author](#for-the-template-author). |

### Default

If unset, defaults to `false`. Tests always run with `HIDE_EXAMPLES=false` (the default) so the example projects supply the e2e fixtures.

Accepted truthy values (case-insensitive): `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on`. Accepted falsy values: `false`, `0`, `no`, `off`, empty. Anything else falls back to `false` with a warning in the build log.

---

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

The site is deployed automatically on every push to `main` (and to `content/add-projects`, if you maintain one — see below).

### One-time setup

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
4. (Optional) Add a custom domain under **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
5. (Optional) If you want to hide the examples on your deployed site, add a repository variable `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true` (see [Hiding the examples](#hiding-the-examples)).

The first push to `main` after this setup will deploy your site to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (or your custom domain).

### Workflows

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs on every PR and push: lint, typecheck, unit tests, default build, hidden-examples build smoke step, Playwright e2e + axe-core, Lighthouse CI.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — runs on push to `main` and `content/add-projects`: build and deploy to GitHub Pages.

If a build fails, the live site stays untouched.

---

## For the template author

If you're maintaining this repo as both a public template **and** your own personal portfolio, the recommended pattern is to keep two long-lived branches:

- **`main`** — the template. Examples only, no personal content. What forkers see.
- **`content/add-projects`** — your personal portfolio. Real projects added here. Deploy workflow automatically sets `HIDE_EXAMPLES=true` on this branch, so the deployed site shows only your real work.

Template improvements (fixes, features, doc updates) flow `main` → `content/add-projects` via merge or rebase. Project content never lives on both branches at once, so merges are conflict-free.

The full author workflow — branch setup, sync recipes, schema-migration handling, and the GitHub Pages "one source per repo" trade-off — is in [`docs/dual-branch-workflow.md`](./docs/dual-branch-workflow.md).
